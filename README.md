I chose to do my homework in React because for this assignment we needed to make a single page application, and this is essentially what React was created to do. Also, since we were storing data, React's state functions as a good place to store the data as the user progresses throughout the fields. Also, in React it is easy to do conditional rendering, which is important when trying to create dynamic-feeling elements.
